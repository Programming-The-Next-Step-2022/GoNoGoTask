This project contains the Go-No Go task. The task requires participants to respond to certain stimuli ("Go" stimuli) and give no response to others ("No-Go stimuli). For more information about the task see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go/no_go.

The programme allows the user to manipulate characteristics of the task (e.g., stimuli used, time interval between trials) to enable a flexible and user-friendly experience.
