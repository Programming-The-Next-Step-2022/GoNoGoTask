# Go-No Go Task Tutorial

This tutorial will demonstrate how the *gonogo* package is used. The package contains some helper functions alongside the main function, gonogo(). 

## Go-No Go Task in Short

The Go-No Go Task is a widely used test to measure inhibitory control, a cognitive process that enables humans to cancel motor activity after its initiation. It requires the participant to perform an action given certain stimuli (Go stimuli), and inhibit that action under a different set of stimuli (No Go stimuli).

There are two parameters in the experimental design that are especially important: the length of each trial and the relative proportion of the Go and No-Go trials. Fortunately, both these parameters can be easily manipulated in the gonogo() function.

## How to Use the gonogo() Function

The following code gives an example of how the gonogo() function can be used.

```{r The gonogo() function, eval=FALSE}

# Load package
library(gonogo)

# Run the Go-No Go Task and save the output in an object
p1_data <- gonogo(id = "my_name", # specify participant's name or id
                  n_trial = 10, # specify number of trials
                  stimuli = c("A", "X"), # specify Go and No Go stimuli (in that order)
                  inter = .7, # specify length of each trial
                  prb = c(.7, .3)) # specify the probability weights of Go and No Go
                                   # stimuli (in that order)

```

```{r Print Output, echo=FALSE}

knitr::include_graphics(path = "C:/Users/Omistaja/OneDrive/Tiedostot/GitHub/theprojectofmilla/gonogo/example_data.jpg")

```


## How to Read the Output

The gonogo() function returns a dataframe consisting of n_trial (number of trials) rows and six columns:

*id* = participant's name or id as specified 
*response* = response key used on the trial (space when participant responded, none when no response was given)
*correct* = whether the response was correct or not (1=correct, 0=incorrect)
*SDT* = responses categorised according to Signal Detection Theory
*rt* = reaction time in seconds
*stimulus* = the stimulus shown on the trial
